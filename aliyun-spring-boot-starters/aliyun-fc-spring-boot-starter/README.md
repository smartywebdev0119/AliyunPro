This project provides an adapter layer for a Spring Cloud Function application onto [Alibaba Cloud Funtion Compute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/52895.html). You can write an app with a single @Bean of type Function and it will be deployable in Alibaba Cloud if you get the JAR file laid out right.

## Sample Function
